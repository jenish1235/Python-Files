## exercise 1

# 1.First, pick any two numbers you like and store them in the num1 and num2 variables. Delete the comments first
# 2.Next, I want you to delete CONDITION1 and replace it with a valid condition that will check if num1 is greater than num2
# 3.Next, I want you to delete CONDITION2 and replace it with a valid condition that will check if num1 is equal to num2
# 4.Finally, I want you to delete CONDITION2 and replace it with a valid condition that will check if num2 is greater than num1

num1 = 100
num2 = 500

if(num1 > num2):
    print("num1 is bigger than num2")

elif (num1 == num2):
     print("num1 is equal to num2")
    
elif (num2 > num1): 
         print("num2 is bigger than num1")

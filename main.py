# Variables arre just like the small little boxes which stores data in the different programming languages in form of numbers, text, videos, images...
# It can be anything...


# creating the first variable

number = 1

# while creating the variable the word written on the left hand side of the equal to sign is known as name of the variable
# the equal to sign between the name and the data to be assigned to variable is called assignment operator.The Equal to sign is the only assignment operator for giving data to variables
# The Word/number written on the right hand side of the equal to sign while creating the variables is the information of data is to be stored in the variables.


# variables are used to remember the data in a very convienient way


# Note :- Variable names are case sensitive

# i.e. 
number = 1
# and
NUMBER = 1
#  ARE DIFFERENT

# Python is the dynamically typed language whereas other programming languages like java, c etc. are statically typed languages.

# So there is no need of defining the variable type in python language. It understands the variable type automatically.While in languages like java , c etc... we have to define the variable type too.

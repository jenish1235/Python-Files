# Boolean Datatype

# what is boolean?

#  ==> booleans are the building blocks of logic systems.

#  booleans can have basically 2 value:-
# 1. True
# 2. False


# How to create the boolean?

# Most of the programmers makes mistakes while making a boolean.

# That mistake is they spell  the booleans in all lowerase letters. i.e. true ,false

# but instead of it , it is necessary to type them capitalized . i.e. True, False

# some example of boolean variables are given below:-

a = True
b = False

# Normally we don't make the boolean variables we get them usually by performing some logic or you can say operation.

# And it is where the comparision operators are used.

### comparision operators

#  there are mainly 6 types of comparision operators:-
    # 1. >    ==> greater than
    # 2. <    ==> less than
    # 3. ==   ==> equality operator
    # 4. !=   ==> not equal to operator
    # 5. >=   ==> greater than equal to
    # 6. <=   ==> less than equal to 

# Comparision operators returns the boolean values on performing operations.

### if statement and if-else statements ###

    ## if statement:-
        # if statements allows us to make the certain piece of data active if the given condition is satisfied.
#  syntax:-
if ("condition satisfied"):
    "your code written here will be executed"
#  (Refer if.py file in folder)
# the if statements only work when the condition is true , and if the condition is false they wont work
'________________________________________'

## if-else statements

# else statements are usually followed by the if statements to give the 2 condtions to the code 

# and to give more than 2 situation to code elif ("else if") statements arre used

# Logical Operators

# there are mainly 3 Logical Operators
    # 1. and
    # 2. or
    # 3. not


# Logical operators are used to give our programs the bigger conditions or we can say multiple conditions to check


# 'not' operator

# 'Not' is used to make the True to statement false and false statement true  



# 'and' operator

# 'and' operator takes 2 values and returns true if both values are true and if either one of them is false we get false.


# 'or' operator

# 'or' operator takes 2 value and returns true if any one of that values is true and returns false only if both the alues are false.


# We can combine NOT and AND operator together to make a NAND Operator.

# similarly we can combine the or and not operator to make a nor operator

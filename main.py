    # Difference Between Python 2 and Python 3:-

        On dividing numbers in the python 2 it gives the quotient in a whole number various Python 3 gives the quotient in the form of floating number.

    # Float

        The Float is the number /data type in python which is represented in the decimal form rather than representing in the whole number form.

        e.g. = 2.5 is type of float number 
        while 2 is type of whole number

        The % sign is used to use modular function.

'''

a = 1+1 
# addition operator
print(a)

b = 1-1
# subtraction operator
print(b)

c = 1*1
# multiplication operator
print(c)

d = 1/1
# division operator
print(d)

e = 1%1
#  modulo operator
print(e)
